This Readme file documents the development process of the "CheckoutSystem"(Software Development2 Course-Work) project, outlining the difficulties encountered during the coding process, the solutions implemented, bugs fixed, and features added.
Difficulties Encountered

During the development of the "CheckoutSystem" project, the following difficulties were encountered:

    Data Cleaning: The dataset used for the project contained a lot of missing values and inconsistent data type, which made it difficult to analyze the data accurately. For example, there was constant warning about conversion from 'double' to 'float', possible loss of data.

    Algorithm Selection: Choosing the appropriate algorithm for the project was a challenge, as there were several algorithms available that could be used for the same task.

    Memory Issues: There were memory errors that affected the stability and correctness of the program.

Solutions Implemented

To overcome these difficulties, the following solutions were implemented:

    Data Cleaning: To clean the data, I used various data cleaning techniques such as imputing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the data. I could do this by creating a class that encapsulates data and function, using the inline function method. The method allowed me to access and

manipulate data only through the class public interface.

    Algorithm Selection: Several algorithms were tested on the dataset and selected the algorithm that gave the best results.

    Memory Issues: To overcome the memory issues, I applied a technique called "chunking" to process the data in smaller batches, which allowed working with the data without running out of memory.

Bugs Fixed

During the development process, I encountered the following bugs and fixed them:

    Input Validation: The program would accept invalid input, causing it to crash. Bug was fixed by implementing input validation checks.

    Data Inconsistencies: Inconsistent data was causing the program to give incorrect results. I fixed this by cleaning the data and removing any inconsistencies.

    Syntax Errors: Syntax errors were causing the program to crash. I fixed this by thoroughly debugging the code and identifying and fixing any syntax errors.

Features Implemented

The following features were added #-> Writing to and reading from file was implemented. Doing this made it easier to format outputs into a receipt format and read to console.
Conclusion

In conclusion, the "CheckoutSystem" project encountered several difficulties during the coding process, but these were overcome through the implementation of various solutions. Bugs were fixed, and additional features were added to improve the program's functionality.
